	Running the search programs showed that the basic linear search took the most time of  75 seconds.
 Second to the linear search with the pointers of rough 9.5 sec. Binary search and binary search recursive
 both took under a hundredth of a second and those times were similar to the bubble sort and merge. Now, if
 there were a handful of values (Maybe three) and not thousands, the liner search might perform better. It
 is really up to the user, but anything that would take over a minute in this crazy information driven
 world might get you fired.

The linear is much slower because itâ€™s searching ability is just as it sounds that of a line on a graph. It
 is constant limiting the flow of computation.  The other searches are not linear, which means their computation
 graphs represents squared function or logic like models.

Many ways to search and these are just a foot in the door of computation complexity.
